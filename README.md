# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This project creates a work day scheduler that allows the user to input to-do tasks under each hour of the workday. I was responsible for linking dayjs and creating a dynamic table that shows the past, current and future hours. I also wrote code to render stored data so that when the user refreshes the page, data persists.
